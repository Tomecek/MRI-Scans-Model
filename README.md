# MRI-Scans-Model
This repository demonstrates a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for classifying Alzheimer's disease from MRI scans. The model predicts one of four classes:

- Mild Demented
- Moderate Demented
- Non Demented
- Very Demented
It also includes a Grad-CAM visualization to highlight the most important regions in the MRI scans contributing to the model's classification.
